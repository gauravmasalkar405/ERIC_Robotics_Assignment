Welcome to the API documentation. This comprehensive guide will help you understand and interact with the various functionalities of our server. Whether you are a developer looking to integrate with our API or a team member seeking insights into the server architecture, this documentation provides all the necessary information to get you started.


## Introduction

This api is a cutting-edge server application that offers a seamless integration of RESTful endpoints and WebSocket API to enable real-time communication between clients and the server. Our server is built using the popular Express framework for handling HTTP requests and Socket.IO for WebSocket support.
## Purpose

The primary goal of this api is to provide a reliable and scalable solution for handling user interactions, data exchange, and real-time events in a secure manner. It serves as the backend for a range of applications, including real-time collaborative tools, chat applications, gaming platforms, and more.
## Features

RESTful Endpoints: Our server exposes a set of RESTful endpoints to handle various client requests, including user registration, authentication, data retrieval, and more. These endpoints follow standard HTTP methods and offer JSON-based communication.

WebSocket API: To enable real-time bidirectional communication, we have implemented a robust WebSocket API. Clients can establish WebSocket connections with the server and subscribe to specific events, allowing seamless data exchange and instant updates.

Security: Security is paramount in our application. We have implemented token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can access certain endpoints and WebSocket events.

Error Handling: Our server incorporates a comprehensive error handling mechanism to provide meaningful error responses in case of invalid requests or server-side issues.
